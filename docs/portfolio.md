# My Digital Portfolio

Throughout my time with working with digital meadia and technology, my interests have grown in a few different areas. I thoroughly enjoy working with Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom when I do my picture editing. I heavily use Fruity Loops 20 digital audio workspace (DAW) when I make or work with my music projects. I also love using Adobe After Effects and Premiere when I am working on video editing and manipulation. Finally, I have been developing websites and projects in my DIGIT 100 class. This has been giving me the opportunity to work with new programs and techniques. It has also given me the opportunity to showcase just a few of my digital works that I still have access to. Down below are a few!
